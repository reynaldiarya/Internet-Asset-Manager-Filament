## Description

Internet Asset Manager provides a structured approach to monitoring domain portfolios, hosting subscriptions, and VPS instances from a single administrative interface. The platform addresses the operational challenge of tracking renewal dates, costs, and credentials across multiple service providers.

Designed for agencies, freelancers, and organizations managing multiple client assets, the system consolidates infrastructure data with encrypted storage for sensitive credentials and automated status tracking for active and expired services.

## Features

- **Domain Portfolio Management** - Track domain names, registrars, linked hosting, registration and expiry dates, renewal costs, and status with encrypted notes
- **Hosting Subscription Tracking** - Manage hosting packages with server IPs, credentials, provider associations, and billing cycles
- **VPS Instance Management** - Monitor virtual private servers including operating systems, access credentials, and subscription lifecycles
- **Provider and Registrar Directory** - Maintain a centralized database of service providers and domain registrars for consistent referencing
- **Encrypted Credential Storage** - Sensitive data including passwords and notes are encrypted at rest using Laravel's encryption services
- **Administrative Dashboard** - Overview widgets displaying domain distribution by hosting provider and registrar
- **Authentication System** - Secure admin access with login, profile management, password reset, and email verification
- **UUID-Based Records** - All assets use UUID primary keys for enhanced security and API-friendly identifiers
- **Status Monitoring** - Visual indicators for active and expired assets with navigation badges showing active domain counts

- Node.js and npm

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akselerasi-Prima-Digital/internet-asset-manager-filament.git
cd internet-asset-manager-filament
```

2. Install PHP dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

3. Install JavaScript dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Generate application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

6. Configure database connection in `.env`

```
DB_CONNECTION=mariadb
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

7. Run database migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

8. Build frontend assets

```bash
npm run build
```

9. Start the development server

```bash
php artisan serve
npm run dev
```

10. Access the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin`

## Configuration

The application uses a standard Laravel `.env` file for configuration. Key variables include:

### Application

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `APP_NAME` | Application name displayed in admin panel | Laravel |
| `APP_ENV` | Environment mode (local, production) | local |
| `APP_DEBUG` | Enable debug mode | true |
| `APP_URL` | Base application URL | http://localhost |

### Database

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DB_CONNECTION` | Database driver | mariadb |
| `DB_HOST` | Database host | 127.0.0.1 |
| `DB_PORT` | Database port | 3306 |
| `DB_DATABASE` | Database name | example |
| `DB_USERNAME` | Database username | root |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Database password | (empty) |

### Session and Cache

The application uses database-driven sessions and cache storage by default. Ensure the database migrations have been run to create the required tables.

## Usage

### Accessing the Admin Panel

Navigate to `/admin` on your installed instance. The application redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

### Managing Domains

1. Navigate to **Infrastructure > Domain** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Domain** to add a new domain
3. Fill in the domain details including registrar, hosting association, dates, and renewal cost
4. Use the **Notes** field for sensitive information - it is encrypted before storage

### Managing Hosting and VPS

1. Navigate to **Infrastructure > Hosting** or **Infrastructure > Vps**
2. Add new hosting packages or VPS instances with provider associations
3. Server IPs, usernames, and passwords are stored with encryption

### Dashboard Overview

The admin dashboard provides:
- **Domains Per Hosting** - Distribution of domains across hosting providers
- **Domains Per Registrar** - Domain counts grouped by registrar
- **Dashboard Overview** - Summary statistics for all assets

### Artisan Commands

```bash
# Run database migrations
php artisan migrate

# Seed the database with sample data
php artisan db:seed

# Create an admin user (via Filament)
php artisan make:filament-user

# Upgrade Filament components
php artisan filament:upgrade
```
